This is a toy project to brush up my python 3 skills

The goal is to provide a simple search engine for IMDB Top 1000 movies
This projects provides:
1. a fetcher. A script to fetch full credits for topN movies

use `python ./fetcher.py FOLDER_TO_STORE_DOWNLOADED 100` where 100 signifies that we need to download top 100

2. a parser. It parses downloaded full credits to extracts the list of all people worked on the project

`python ./parser.py FOLDER_TO_STORE_DOWNLOADED PATH_TO_OUTPUTED_DB.json``

3. an application. A simple REPL to do lookups.

You can launch it using
`python ./application.py PATH_TO_OUTPUTED_DB.json`

Type `quit` to quit.
